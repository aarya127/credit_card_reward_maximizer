      "Best Credit Card for Earning Travel PointsTravel programs typically offer the best redemption value of all rewards credit cards. Whether they offer rewards, points or miles, these cards will always provide more value than cashback cards (even if the flexibility the latter provides is nice to have). Most programs allow members to redeem rewards for flights, vacation packages, upgrades and other travel savings. Some programs also allow point conversions to other popular travel programs. Additionally, many of our top picks feature insurance coverage and exclusive offers like lounge access or benefits at hotels and resorts.

      "To be eligible for most travel credit cards, you need to have a credit score of 650 or higher. If you have poor or fair credit, you may want to improve your credit score before applying for a travel credit card. You can rebuild your credit before you start looking for a rewards credit card, with a balance transfer credit card, which makes it easier to pay off your bill faster if interest is piling up on you or another option is a secured credit card. Some travel credit cards also require a minimum income; either individual or household income. Be sure to check this required qualification before applying.\n",

      "Do travel credit cards come with an annual fee?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most travel credit cards come with an annual fee ranging from $100-$150. This is because travel credit cards yield high value rewards. Often the rewards value make up for the fee you pay annually given your spend or how cleverly you spend in the categories that earns you multipliers. Therefore, the annual fee is a small price to pay for the exclusive rewards and perks. Some banks and financial institutions may waive the first-year annual fee as part of a sign-up bonus.\n",

      "Pros and cons of travel credits cardsIf you’re a frequent flyer, using a travel credit card can help you access a variety of travel rewards and benefits, such as travel rewards points, hotel upgrades, complimentary lounge access and much more. There are also a few thing to consider before you apply for one.Here are the main pros and cons of using a travel credit card.Pros of using a travel credit cardHigher earn rates: Popular travel credit cards offer high earning rates for points on every dollar spent, allowing you to earn points faster than other rewards cards.Welcome bonus offers: Travel credit cards usually come with great bonus offers such as introductory bonus points or gift cards. Such big bonus offers can quickly catapult you in your path towards redeeming big rewards and offset the annual fee. Travel rewards: Most travel credit cards offer points or travel miles each time you make payments through your travel credit card, allowing you to rack up travel rewards that can make your trips more enjoyable. Some points programs also offer non-travel rewards such as gift cards, consumer goods, or statement credits, allowing you to choose what you like to redeem your points for.Insurance coverage: Many travel credit cards come with a variety of travel insurance benefits such as trip cancellation, accident coverage, lost baggage coverage and car rental insurance. If you tend to travel frequently, such travel insurance coverages will reduce, or even eliminate, the costs associated with such trip disruptions.Perks: Your travel credit card can also come with attractive perks such as complimentary airport lounge access, hotel room upgrades and discounts on fine dining and entertainment. Such credit card perks can elevate your travel experience to a whole new level.Brand partnerships: Several credit card providers team up with brands to offer you brand loyalty rewards such as Air Mile bonus points, Air Canada discounts, Marriott hotel upgrades, and Visa fine dining events. So, if you’re interested in a particular brand or are already earning perks through them, a travel credit card partnered with them can boost your rewards redemption rate.Cons of using a travel credit cardFluctuating rewards programs: One thing to keep in mind is that travel credit cards aren’t always consistent, and their offers and points values can change suddenly. Such changes can potentially decrease the value of the points you’ve already earned and make the rewards redemption rate slower than before.Blackout dates: Also, some travel credit card rewards programs may include blackout dates, meaning you cannot take advantage of some of the perks during that period. These blackout dates usually occur during peak travel seasons like the holidays. Ask the credit card provider for more information about blackout dates.High annual credit card fee: Many travel credit cards come with a high annual fee, which can sometimes seem to outweigh the overall pros of the card if you’re not earning rewards points. If you’re planning on using a travel card as your main credit card and you think you’ll be able to offput the fees with points earned, then it may be worth getting the card.High interest charges: If you carry a balance month-to-month on a travel credit card — or on any rewards card — interest will compound, making it harder to pay off your card. Not only that, but the interest also you rack up will cancel out any points you’ve earned.Foreign transaction fees: Some travel credit cards may come with a foreign transaction fee, which will be applied to all non-CAD purchases, whether in-store or online. This fee can be as high as 3% for some travel credit cards. If you want to use your credit card for frequent foreign currency purchases, look for a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees.Mainly travel related rewards: Most travel credit cards mainly offer travel related rewards and benefits such as travel miles and travel insurance. If you’re looking for rewards such as cash back, you might want to reconsider getting a travel rewards card.\n",
