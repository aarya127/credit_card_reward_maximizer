      "1. **Travel Insurance**: The card comes with travel insurance that covers you for up to 3 days, including trip cancellation, interruption, and delay insurance, as well as travel medical insurance.\n",
      "2. **Travel Assistance**: You'll have access to a 24/7 travel assistance service, which can help you with things like flight reservations, hotel bookings, and travel documentation.\n",
      "3. **Purchase Protection and Extended Warranty**: While not exclusively a travel benefit, the card's purchase protection and extended warranty can provide peace of mind when making travel-related purchases, such as luggage or travel gear.\n",
      "4. **Travel Discounts**: As a Desjardins member, you may be eligible for discounts on travel packages, flights, and hotels through Desjardins' travel agency, Desjardins Travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that the Desjardins Flexi Visa card is a basic, no-fee credit card, so the travel benefits are not as comprehensive as those offered by more premium travel credit cards. If you're a frequent traveler, you may want to consider a card with more extensive travel benefits, such as travel rewards, airport lounge access, or more comprehensive travel insurance."
